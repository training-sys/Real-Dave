I will complete the remaining major features and layout enhancements to fully flesh out the "Real Dave" CRM.

### **1. Layout Enhancements**
*   **Header Upgrade**: Add a User Profile section (Avatar, Name, Logout) and Notifications icon to the top header in `MainLayout.jsx`.

### **2. New Feature Pages**
I will replace the placeholder `GenericPage` with fully functional components for:

*   **Projects (`/projects`)**:
    *   List view of real estate projects (Name, Location, Status, Total Units).
    *   "Add Project" Drawer with fields for project details.
*   **Contacts (`/contact`)**:
    *   Address book for Clients, Agents, and Partners.
    *   "Add Contact" Drawer with key details (Name, Role, Phone, Email, Source).
*   **Tasks (`/tasks`)**:
    *   Task management list (ToDo, Calls, Meetings).
    *   "Add Task" Drawer with Due Date, Priority, and Description.
*   **Deals (`/deals`)**:
    *   Pipeline view (or list) showing active deals, stages, and values.
    *   "Add Deal" Drawer to track sales progress.

### **3. Secondary Pages (Time Permitting)**
*   **Loans**: Basic tracking of loan applications.
*   **Profile**: User profile settings form.
*   **Settings**: General application settings.

I will implement these sequentially, starting with the Layout and the core "Big 4" modules (Projects, Contacts, Tasks, Deals).
