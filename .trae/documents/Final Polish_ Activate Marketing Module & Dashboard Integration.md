I will implement the final 15% to reach 100% completeness by ensuring **Advt. Booster** is fully functional (saving data) and the Dashboard reflects all activities.

### **1. Activate Advt. Booster (Real Data Saving)**
*   **Update `DataContext.jsx`**: Add a `campaigns` state to store marketing campaigns in `localStorage`.
*   **Update `AdvtBooster.jsx`**:
    *   Replace the "Simulation" alert with actual **Save Logic**.
    *   Add a **"Recent Campaigns" List** below the builder so you can track created ads.
    *   Display "Active" vs "Completed" status.

### **2. Enhance Dashboard**
*   **Add "Marketing" Widget**: Show a summary of Active Campaigns on the main Dashboard so the user sees the impact of the new module.

### **3. Final Polish**
*   **Profile Page**: Verify the "Edit Profile" feature persists changes (already confirmed, but will double-check UI).
*   **Settings**: Ensure Company Name/Logo updates reflect immediately in the sidebar (already confirmed).

**Outcome**: The "Advt. Booster" will no longer be a UI toy; it will be a functional module for tracking ad spending and plans. The Dashboard will give a true 360-degree view of the business.
